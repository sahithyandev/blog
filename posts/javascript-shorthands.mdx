I love JavaScript, I hope you too. JavaScript is super-simple for beginners, even it has many WTF situations. By using shorthands, you can be more productive & you can impress your friends when coding. I want to show you some shorthands in JavaScript. They’re great.

## 1. parseInt()

```javascript
let x = "11"
console.log(parseInt(x)) // 100
```

parseInt is a function in JavaScript which is used to convert a string to a number. There is an awesome shorthand is available for parseInt. “+” is the shorthand. It’s very easy when writing a 1000-line-JS.

```javascript
let y = "100"
console.log(+y) // 100
```

It works with **parseFloat()** too.

## 2. Math.floor()

```javascript
let z = 14.45
console.log(Math.floor(z)) // returns 14
```

Math.floor is a function that is used to return the largest integer value that is less than or equal to a number. **“~~”** is the shorthand for this function. I hope you have a smile now.

```javascript
console.log(~~z) // returns 14 
```

## 3. String to Boolean

```javascript
let strValue = "true"
let boolValue = strValue == "true" ? true : false // true
```

I am sure you will think that is shorthand. But there is a shorthand for this too. The operator used above is called a Ternary operator. You can use this as a shorthand for an If-Else loop. The below code is a shorthand for the string to boolean conversion. It also works for number values too.

```javascript
let boolValue = !!strValue // returns true
```

## 4. If-Else statement

As mentioned earlier, you can use the ternary operator as shorthand for the If-Else statement-based assignment. But when using multiline-blocks in If-Else statement, the ternary operator wants to be extended as shown below.

```javascript
age > 13 ? (
// age is higher than 13
) : (
// age is not higher than 13
)
```

## 5. XOR gate?

We all know AND-OR gates. We use them in many places. Some of them may have heard the XOR gate. It is a mixture of AND-OR concepts. Here is the truth table for the XOR gate. for more.

<!-- TODO an example here -->

The XOR gate returns true if the number of inputs is odd. Sometimes we want this too. AND and OR can be accessed in JS with && and || operators respectively. But how we can access XOR?

```javascript
let A = true
let B = false
// the below two lines will work as XOR.
console.log((A && !B) || (!A && B)) // returns true
console.log((A + B) && (!A + !B)) // returns true
```

But the above code is too big and we want a lot of time to write it without any problem. The problem can be solved with just a “^”.

```javascript
// Shorthand
console.log(true ^ false) // ^ works as XOR
```

The above short-handed code will work. But there is a small problem with the operator, it returns a number instead of a boolean. You can simply convert it into a boolean with the shorthand #3.

## 6. string.split('')

Sometimes, we want to split a string into one-letter-array as shown below.

```javascript
let name = "Sahithyan" // my name
let letters = name.split('') // [S, a, h, i, t, h, y, a, n]
```

In most cases, it’s ok to write .split(‘’) one or two times in our code. But when we want to split a string into a letter array, this gets horrible. But, fortunately, there is a shorthand for the split method.

```javascript
let name = "Sahithyan" // again my name
let letters = [...name] // [S, a, h, i, t, h, y, a, n]
```

Unfortunately, I don’t know what happens there. if you know, please tell that in the comments. But I am sure that it works.
