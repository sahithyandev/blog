Hello people! Welcome to my blog!. This is my blog, built with [Next.js](), [MDX]() and a [few other open source packages]().

After thinking of starting a blog for about a week, I finally decided to start developing it. As the first blog post, I am writing about how I created this blog. 

### First, WHY?

I, occasionally, write to share my insights. In the past, I used [Medium](https://www.medium.com), a famous writing site. But its *Only 2 free stories per month* plan bothered me so much. This is not just me, many of the people hate Medium for this.

So I decided to create it on my own. Because, by creating my own website, I can be my own boss. I can style and structure this my blog, however I want. Medium can't give me that power. That's why I am reinventing the wheel.

### How I built it?

This blog was initiated with [Next.js](), a React framework that makes it easy to do server side rendering.
Then [MDX]() was added. MDX is JSX and Markdown combined.

Posts are server-rendered on each request. People may ask, "why don't you render them as static files at build time?". Well, yes, I can. But it's not that much necessary.

### Packages I used

In this section, I mentioned all the top-level packages, that I used to build this blog.

- [gray-matter]() - To compile the MDX files into JS objects
- [next-mdx-remote]() - To render MDX dynamically
- [next]() - The next framework
- [react]() - Because next is build on top of react
- [react-dom]()
