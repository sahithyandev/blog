Hello people! Welcome to my blog!. This is my blog, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and a [few other open source packages](#packages-i-used).

After thinking of starting a blog for about a week, I finally decided to start developing it. And as the first blog post, I wanted to write about how I created this blog. I hope it's helpful.

<linkableH2 slug={slug}>First, WHY?</linkableH2>

I, occasionally, write to share my insights. In the past, I used [Medium](https://www.medium.com), a famous writing site, to write my insights as articles. But I didn't like their *Only 2 free stories per month* plan. Hence, I started looking for alternatives. And nothing seemed suitable for me.

So I decided that I should create one on my own for me. Because, by creating my own website, I can be my own boss. I can style and structure this my blog, however I want. Medium can't give me that power. That's why I started reinventing the wheel.

<linkableH2 slug={slug}>How I built it?</linkableH2>

This blog was initiated with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), The React Framework for Production.

I wanted to write using Markdown as it's easy to use. As I was searching for a markdown-to-html compiler, I came across [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). MDX is Markdown and JSX combined. It seemed more powerful. Hence, I decided to use it.

At first, I went with Server-side rendering. But now, I changed to static build.

<linkableH2 slug={slug}>Packages I used</linkableH2>

In this section, I mentioned all the packages, that I installed for a specific use. (That means, I left the framework's dependencies)

- [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) - To compile the MDX files into JS objects
- [next-mdx-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-remote) - To compile MDX into html 
- [mdx-prism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-prism) - To use prism (for syntax highlighting) with MDX
